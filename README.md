Reproducible pipeline for **single-cell RNA-seq analysis of pancreatic β-cells** from healthy and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) donors.  
This project replicates and extends the workflow from [Segerstolpe et al_., *Cell Metabolism* 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2016.08.020), using **Nextflow**, **STAR**, and **DESeq2** to profile gene expression changes and β-cell heterogeneity.

---

## 🚀 Motivation
- Type 2 Diabetes affects 1 in 9 individuals worldwide (IDF 2025).  
- β-cells in islets of Langerhans are central to insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.  
- Bulk RNA-seq misses heterogeneity; **single-cell RNA-seq** resolves subpopulations and disease-related signatures.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a reproducible scRNA-seq pipeline (QC → alignment → quantification → DE analysis).  
- Compare transcriptomes of healthy vs T2D β-cells.  
- Identify differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways.

## 📊 Key Results
- Identified downregulation of *INS* and *PDX1* in T2D beta cells.  
- Revealed heterogeneity within beta cells (RBP4+ subpopulations).  
- GSEA showed enrichment of stress and metabolic pathways.
